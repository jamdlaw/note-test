# note-test
purpose: self coding project and music game. I want to make a game that would help me learn the notes of either guitar, piano, sining or really any intremnt. 
the way I see this game working the player would chose a number of secounds to play a random note. the program asks for a note to be played and the player has the time limit set to play the correct note. This program should have a tuner so it can listen and decode the correct pitches. 
log:
starting on this project tomorrow 5/31
06/07 going to add the function that can tell when the requested note
and the note being played are the same.
06/29 game now compares and add to a score when the user gets the answer right, next thing to do is reset the level when a user gets the answer right.
